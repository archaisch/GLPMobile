About
-----

The thread listing pages of GLP are not comfortable to view on phones. This
project is a very simple attempt to provide a minimalist application for viewing
threads on newer android devices.
This project is not affiliated with Godlike Productions, GLP or Zero Point Ltd.


TODO
----

- Implement Custom ListView for viewing thread feed with multiple elements in fragment
- Look into partial/lazy loading and caching strategies for fetched page feeds
- Implement ability to view individual thread posts and figure out how to handle pages (may need to parse html w/ jsoup)
- Implement share action in actionbar for easy sharing thread titles & links
- More to follow...
